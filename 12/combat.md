# Combat
Player Characters are hero-adventurers who delve forgotten dungeons, explore untamed wilderness, and sometimes even find themselves in other planes of existence, standing toe-to-toe with all manner of villains, monsters, and worse. It is inevitable that in overcoming these foes there will be battles and so it is important for all players to know the basic rules for handling combat.

The game would quickly become boring if every encounter was reduced to systematically hacking-and-slashing through opponents so this chapter will cover more than the basic mechanics of hitting or missing, and will present special ways to attack and defend, the use of poisons, rules for turning undead, and more.

### Monster Ability Scores
Many options detailed in this chapter make use of physical ability scores, particularly Strength and Dexterity. As Monster Manual entries do not have stats for monsters, the DM will have to decide whether to generate ability scores for an individual creature, to infer them from other monster stats, or to simply assign them based on best judgement. Suggestions for generating and inferring ability scores for monsters are given in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

For player's who are trying to decide whether or not it is worthwhile to attempt a given action against a specific creature, however a very rough guideline is that greater size typically equates to greater strength and constitution, while faster movement often suggests higher dexterity.

### The Combat Round
If an encounter escalates (or devolves) into combat, the time scale of the game automatically goes to rounds. Rounds are used to measure the actions of characters in combat (and in other circumstances where timing is important).

A round is approximately one minute long in-game. Ten combat rounds equal a turn (e.g. about 10 minutes of game time). This is particularly important to remember for spells that last for turns, rather than rounds. These are of course just approximations--precise time measurements are impossible to make in combat. Something that takes only a few moments to accomplish under normal circumstances could become an undertaking of heroic scale when attempted in the middle of the chaos of battle.

There is no subdivision of the round into smaller discrete units of time, but what are sometimes called segments are used to establish the order in which events unfold within a round.  Weapon speeds, casting times of spells that are less than 1 round, etc. are common examples. They are relative amounts of time rather than a specific number of seconds. 

### What You Can Do in One Round
A character can accomplish **one basic action within a combat round**. The round represents approximately a minute of chaotic back-and-forth activity, not a single motion, and each basic action - whether attacking, casting a spell, drinking a potion, or something else - includes incidental actions that do not *need* to be described or adjudicated. 

For example a melee attack is not simply a swing of a sword, it represents the flurry of testing strikes, feints, parries, and footwork as the combatants seek an opening to exploit for a more telling blow. The dice are adjudicating the *overall outcome* of these efforts. When characters gain the ability to make multiple attacks per round, it is not because they are suddenly moving faster but because they are better able to create opportunities within that same span of frantic activity.

Likewise even a 'simple' task such as quaffing a potion involves more than just lifting a bottle. In the heat of battle, the character must keep their footing, free a hand, rummage through their pack, uncork and finally swallow a potion, all while fending off threats, avoiding strikes, and withstanding spells. 

A combat round therefore contains about a full minute of effort, which the rules reduce to one basic action **plus** whatever **incidental movements and reactions** occur within that time.

Some examples of what can be done in a round:
- Make an attack (may involve multiple attack rolls)
- Cast a spell (if the casting time is less than 1 round)
- Use a magical item
- Drink a potion
- Light a torch
- Bind a wound
- Search a body
- Recover a dropped weapon

In addition there are actions that take a negligible amount of time that a character may do without affecting their ability to perform a more important task, examples include:
- shout brief warnings, demands, or commands (but not carry on full conversations)
- drop a weapon and draw another
- Shed excess equipment such as backpacks

,## The Combat Sequence
In real life, combat is close to pure anarchy, filled with confusion and uncertainty. To play out a battle in a game however it is necessary to impose some order. Consequently, within a combat round there are a fixed series of steps that must be followed:
1. DM Action Determination
2. Player Action Declaration
3. Determine Initiative
4. Resolution of Actions
5. Resolution of Round

### Step 1. DM Action Determination 
The round begins with the DM secretly deciding the actions that will be taken (including specific spells to be cast, if any) by all characters under their control. The DM is on their honour not to change actions or spells after learning the player' intended actions - after all, the Monsters/NPCs don't know what the PCs are going to do. If necessary, the DM should make brief notes.

In choosing these actions the DM will normally choose whatever is likely to be the most advantageous/sensible for the situation and type of creature, for example creatures that benefit from swarming an opponent will likely try to do so, creatures that are severely injured will likely try to withdraw or flee, if reinforcements are nearby they will try to alert them if they are being overwhelmed, etc. 

### Step 2. Player Action Declaration
Once the DM has made their decision, they will ask the players to state (broadly) what their characters will be attempting to do, including specific spells to be cast (if any). At this point the players are *usually* free to informally discuss amongst themselves, coordinating tactics, planning movement and positioning, revising battle priorities, and may also ask the DM for rule clarifications. The DM may however limit or entirely restrict this discussion (except for rule clarifications) to reflect applicable in-game conditions such as magical silence and surprise.

Players are expected to keep this discussion as brief as is necessary to decide what their individual characters will try to do (and if the discussion is going in circles, increasing decision paralysis rather than reducing it, or otherwise taking an unreasonable amount of time, the DM may tell the players to wrap it up) . At the end of this discussion each player declares what action their character will take. **Actions that must be declared** include:
- Attacks, indicating which weapon(s), style of unarmed attack
- Covering
- Guarding
- Holding
- Parrying
- Special manoeuvres (called shots, grappling, backstabs, etc.) Note: some manouevres are **not** declared, refer to their descriptions
- Special Types of movement (withdrawing, charging, running)
- Casting a spell, indicating the specific spell
- Using an Item (potions, wands, scrolls, etc.)
- Using a psionic power, indicating which is being used

These actions are described in more detail throughout this chapter.

### Step 3. Determine Initiative
Once all players have declared their actions, the DM will call for initiative to be rolled. This determines the order in which the declared actions will happen within the round. The DM should specify which method of initiative the players are to use (a table rule may define one method as a default), who is making the roll in the case of the group or modified group initiative methods, and indicate any [[12f. Initiative#Modifiers to Initiative|group initiative modifiers]] that apply to the roll.

With the individual and modified group initiative methods each player is responsible for applying all applicable modifiers and keeping track of their initiative for the round. With the group initiative method the player that is called on to make the roll is responsible for applying the group initiative modifier to the roll and keeping track of the final value.

The methods and modifiers are explained in more detail under the heading [[12f. Initiative|Initiative]] below.

### Step 4. Resolution of Actions
With initiative established, the next step is to determine the success or failure of each combatant's actions. The DM will call on the player to describe what their character does. In response to changing battle conditions, and subject to the rules given later, players may choose to abandon, delay (hold), or change a declared action, and should indicate this immediately when called on. If the player is continuing with their declared action they should describe the path of any movement (or if applicable move their token along its path) and detail their characters action. Players are encouraged to sprinkle some so-to-speak 'narrative flair' to their description if they are comfortable doing so, but are not required to. The DM will interject as needed to call for any rolls.

### Step 5. Resolution of Round
After all actions for the round have been resolved, the DM handles any remaining effects and administrative tasks. These end-of-round checks ensure that ongoing conditions and time-based effects are applied correctly. The DM resolves them in whatever order is most convenient, but the following elements are typically addressed:
1. **Update Status Effects**  
    This includes:
    - Applying continuing effects of spells cast in previous rounds whose durations have not expired.
    - Resolving spells with a casting time of one full round or more, if their casting finishes this round.
    - Applying ongoing or delayed damage (poison, acid, fire, bleeding, etc.).
    - Confirming or updating the conditions of characters: knocked down, stunned, grappled, bound, slowed, and similar states.
2. **Repositioning Due to Forced-Movement**  
    Characters who were forced to retreat, pushed, knocked back, or displaced are shifted to their final positions on the battlefield.
3. **Determine Fatigue**  
    If the optional fatigue rules are used, the DM checks whether any character or creature becomes fatigued this round due to exertion, environment, or special abilities.
4. **Morale Checks (NPCs and Monsters)**  
    The DM makes morale checks as required by the situation—typically when significant losses occur, leaders fall, or other shock events unfold.

Once these tasks are complete, the battlefield state is fully updated and another combat round begins with **Step 1: DM Action Determination**.

## Movement and Position
Before delving into the actions characters can take in combat, it is necessary to explain how and when characters can move in battle, and the effects of where and how they are positioned.

### Movement in Combat

#### Movement Rate
As discussed in the Adventuring chapter, a character’s base movement rate is determined by their race or species. For playable races, this value is given in the racial descriptions in Chapter 4; for monsters, it appears in their stat block. To recap, the most common base movement rates for playable races are **12** for Medium creatures and **6** for Small creatures. These base values may be increased or decreased by ability scores, class or kit features, spell effects, injuries, encumbrance, and other factors.

In combat, a character’s movement rate is equal to the number of squares the character may traverse on a standard battle map (a 5-foot grid) in a full round (1 minute) of movement. This represents the cautious, tactical movement demanded by battle conditions: assessing obstacles, scanning for threats, and looking for opportunities to exploit.

#### Dividing Movement
Movement is an allowance for the entire round and, with certain exceptions, may be divided and expended before taking an action, between attacks with the same weapon, or after taking an action, so long as the total movement allowance for the round is not exceeded. All movement must be taken when the character has initiative to act (see _Initiative_, below).

While movement in reality has a time component that would affect the order in which actions occur and where creatures are when effects take place, to reduce bookkeeping and simplify play, movement is treated as though it occurs instantaneously while the character has initiative to act. No voluntary movement occurs outside a character’s initiative unless another rule specifically allows it.

When characters act simultaneously due to an initiative tie, it is the **action** that occurs simultaneously. Any movement taken before the action is completed for all such characters first, then actions are resolved with characters at the locations where they perform those actions, followed by any remaining movement.

If a character has multiple attacks with the same weapon, they may divide their movement freely between those attacks, moving before an attack, after an attack, or both, so long as their total movement for the round is not exceeded.

#### Shifting
Some actions, such as spellcasting, restrict movement for the round or operate by different rules when combined with movement (for example, rate of fire for missile attacks). For the purposes of such rules, a character may **shift** to an adjacent grid square on their initiative count, immediately before their action is resolved; this shift **does not count as movement**.

A shift represents a minor adjustment in position, such as stepping to maintain or regain a line of fire. For example, an archer may shift one square to bring a target back into view without affecting their rate of fire.

If a shift causes the character to become visible to an enemy that did not previously have line of sight to them (for example, the character had **greater than 90% cover or concealment** from that enemy), and that enemy has at least one **ranged or thrown weapon attack remaining** for the round, the enemy may immediately resolve **one** such attack against the shifting character. This attack is resolved **before** the shifting character’s action and may disrupt spellcasting or other actions as normal.

A shift may also provoke **attacks of opportunity** as described elsewhere, if the normal conditions for such attacks are met. 

### Specific Types of Movement
The following types of combat movement must be declared before initiative is rolled. When performing one of these movement types, the character’s movement **may not be divided**, and any unused portion of the movement allowance is lost. For example, a character cannot complete a charge and then use remaining movement afterward, nor partially withdraw and then move normally.

#### Charging
Charging is rapid movement across the battlefield intended to end with an attack. A charging character may move up to **one and one-half times** their movement rate and make a single attack. The momentum of the charge grants a **+2 bonus** to this attack. Some weapons inflict double damage when used in a charge, as noted in the Master Weapons Table.

A charging character however also suffers a **+2 penalty to initiative**, loses any Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and incurs an additional **+1 penalty to AC**. In addition, they suffer **double damage** from defenders who are set to receive a charge and make a successful attack.

#### Running and Sprinting
In combat, running allows a character to double their movement but, except for tackles, prevents them from taking any other action in the round, including making opportunity attacks. It is also dangerous to move rapidly through a battlefield: while running, as with charging, a character loses any Dexterity bonus to Armor Class and suffers an additional **+1 penalty to AC**. Further, if they run into the threatened area of a creature that is set against a charge, they suffer the same doubled damage as if they had been charging.

If a character has declared that they are running, on their initiative count they may attempt to **sprint** instead, achieving greater speed. To sprint, they must make a Strength check. If successful, their movement is tripled instead of doubled. They may then choose to attempt a second Strength check at a **–4 penalty** to further increase their speed. If this second check succeeds, their movement is quadrupled, and they may attempt a final Strength check at a **–8 penalty** to achieve quintuple speed. If any Strength check fails, the character does not increase their speed further but may continue moving at the speed already achieved.

At the end of a round of sprinting, the character must make a Constitution check with a penalty based on the **highest speed reached during that round**: **–1 for triple speed, –2 for quadruple speed, or –3 for quintuple speed**. If the check fails, the character is exhausted and may move only at half their normal movement rate in the following round.

If the check succeeds, the character may continue sprinting in the next round at the same speed or at a lower speed without rolling additional Strength checks. If they are not already moving at quintuple speed and have not failed any Strength checks during the current run, they may also attempt to increase their speed using the same rules as above.

At the end of each subsequent round of running or sprinting, a Constitution check must be made. **The penalties from each round of sprinting during the current run are cumulative**. Slowing to a lower speed can reduce or prevent additional penalties from being added for that round but does not remove penalties already accumulated. The accumulated penalty persists until the run ends (i.e., the character spends one full round moving at normal speed or less).

#### Withdrawing
Withdrawing is the only safe way to leave a square threatened by an opponent, carefully backing away while keeping one’s face toward the enemy and one’s guard up. A withdrawing character may move up to **half their movement rate** and does not provoke opportunity attacks from enemies they are aware of in their front or flanks (see _Facing_, below), but may still provoke attacks from unseen enemies or those to their rear.

A character who is withdrawing cannot attack, cast spells, or use most items during that round, but may still make opportunity attacks.

Because an opponent may, on their own initiative, choose to follow a withdrawing character in order to keep them threatened, withdrawal is most effective when the withdrawing character acts on a later initiative count than their enemy or when an ally also threatens the same opponent, impeding pursuit.

The alternative way to retreat from combat is fleeing, which is simply running for a specific purpose and follows the normal rules for running.

### Positioning

#### Stance (Kneeling, Sitting, and Prone)
While most fighting is done on one's feet, character's may adopt - or be forced into - different positions. As a generalisation a position closer to the ground decreases the risk of being hit by ranged attacks, but simultaneously increases the risk of being struck by melee attacks.

A **kneeling** character gains a -1 bonus to AC against missile-like attacks, but a melee attack against them is made with a +2 bonus. A character may use any weapon without penalty while kneeling.

A **sitting** character has the same bonuses and penalties as a kneeling character, but can only use a crossbow, blowgun or small-size firearm (if available) without penalty from this position. All other weapons incur a -2 penalty to attack. (note that a rider is mounted, *not* sitting)

A **prone** character gains a -2 bonus to AC against missile-like attacks, but melee attacks against them are made with a +4 bonus. A prone character may only use crossbows and firearms (again, if available) at 1/2 the usual rate of fire, blowguns, or small-sized melee weapons. A prone character attempting to make a melee attack suffers a -4 penalty to hit, thrown weapons do not suffer this penalty to attack.

A character may drop into a lower position as a free action. Rising from prone to kneeling/sitting, or from kneeling/sitting to standing increases the characters initiative by 2 and imposes a -2 penalty to any subsequent attacks made in the round. Rising directly from prone to standing requires a full round - the character can do nothing else. 

A character may not benefit simultaneously from both positional modifiers (kneeling, sitting, prone) and cover. If a character is covered, the cover modifier applies and their position is irrelevant for purposes of defense.

A character’s position may, however, determine whether they can claim cover in the first place (for example, kneeling behind a low wall). If cover is later lost—for instance, if an opponent moves to bypass or negate the cover—then the character’s positional modifiers immediately apply once again.

#### Facing
Facing is the direction a character is oriented in during combat, defining their front, flanks, and rear. It determines what they can see and how effectively they can respond to attacks from various directions. A character’s **front** is the arc within their field of vision, the **flanks** are the areas at the edge of that vision, and the **rear** is their blind spot.

For Medium or smaller creatures when using a square grid battle map, the **front** consists of the three squares directly ahead of the character (the square they face and one to either side). The **rear** is the corresponding three squares directly opposite the front. The **flanks** are the remaining square on each side. Larger creatures occupy more grid squares, and the number of squares in each arc increases proportionally with their size and shape. A number of unusual creatures, for example jellies and otyughs, do not have an identifiable 'front' flanks or rears and all areas are treated as front.

Unless a player specifies otherwise, characters are assumed to face the enemy they are currently engaging, or—if not actively fighting—the nearest creature they are aware of. When threatened by multiple foes, it is similarly assumed that the character adjusts their facing to minimize the number of enemies in their rear arc and maximize those in their front, with the caveat that an enemy they are currently engaging must remain in their front arc or their attack is lost. When moving characters are assumed to face in the direction of movement, except when withdrawing. Players may opt to specify a different facing for their character, remembering they cannot engage a creature that is not to their front. Characters may change facing immediately when they first become aware of a creature that threatens them, when a creature they are aware of ceases to threaten them, or on their initiative count. 

#### Reach
Reach is the distance at which a creature can make a melee attack against an opponent. It is determined by the weapon wielded, if any, and the creature’s size.

A weapon’s reach is given in the Master Weapons Table, expressed as a number of grid squares on a 5-foot battle map. Weapons with a reach of 1 (5 feet) may attack only creatures in squares immediately adjacent to the wielder.

Weapons with a reach greater than 1 and which deal slashing and/or bludgeoning damage may attack any square within their reach. Weapons that deal *only piercing damage*, however, may attack **only at the maximum extent of their reach**, and not at nearer squares. Such weapons (including lances and pikes) are designed and balanced for thrusting with the point and cannot be effectively used to strike adjacent foes.

A monster’s natural attacks are assumed to have a base weapon reach of 1 (5 feet) unless the creature’s description suggests otherwise.
The reach of a creature’s weapon, *including natural weapons*, is modified by the creature’s size. Large creatures increase weapon reach by 1 square, Huge creatures by 2 squares, and Gargantuan creatures by 3 squares.

Creatures normally cannot make melee attacks **through a an occupied square** to strike an enemy farther away, regardless of their reach. An intervening creature is assumed to block swings, limit space, and interfere with timing. Weapons that deal only piercing damage are an exception and may be thrust through an occupied square to attack at the maximum extent of it's reach unless the DM rules the intervening creature completely blocks the line of attack. Another exception is creatures fighting in a formation, who may make melee attacks through a square occupied by an ally as it is assumed that their movements are coordinated to allow

Other exceptional circumstances may allow attacks through an occupied square at the DM’s discretion. For example, a monster’s tentacles might strike over or around an intervening foe, or a character swinging a polearm might be able to attack over a smaller creature to strike a much larger opponent.

#### Threatening
The area where a character can potentially make attacks is the area that creature 'threatens'. This area is determined by reach, and facing (and thus *indirectly* by creature size). A creature only threatens the squares that are to their front and within reach of their attack. Remember however, as explained in the facing rules above, that a creature is assumed to adjust their facing based on the threats they are aware of - a creature that has no threats nearby consequently threatens all squares in reach for any enemy it is aware of, while a creature currently engaged against an opponent, must keep that opponent in their front or lose their attack (and possibly trigger an opportunity attack by their change in facing as described later.)

#### Flanking
Flanking is an attempt to exploit an opponent's facing, whether it is multiple attackers trying to position themselves so that at least one attacker is either to the rear or a flank, or by using surprise, stealth, and subterfuge to sneak up behind the target unseen.

Attacks from a flank gain a +1 bonus to hit. Attacks from the rear gain a +2 bonus to hit ***and*** the target's bonuses to AC from dexterity or a shield (unless the shield is slung on the character's back) do not apply to an attack from the rear.

#### Cover and Concealment
An effective tactic for avoiding missile fire and some spell effects is to hide behind obstacles—commonly referred to as **taking cover**. _Cover_ (sometimes called _hard cover_) consists of solid obstacles that physically block attacks, while _concealment_ (or _soft cover_) obscures the target without providing substantial physical protection. Stone walls, wooden palisades, and overturned tables are examples of cover; curtains, fog, smoke, and bushes are examples of concealment.

When a creature is targeted by a missile attack or an applicable spell, the DM considers the nature, size, density, and placement of all intervening obstacles (including creatures*) that the line of fire—a straight line from the center of the attacker to the center of the target—passes through. The DM also considers the size, stance, and awareness of the target; creatures with an Intelligence score lower than 3 will rarely make effective use of cover.

Based on these factors, the DM determines whether the obstacles collectively provide cover or concealment, and how much of the target is hidden from that attacker.

For missile attacks, the value from the table below is applied as a **penalty to the attack roll**. For **hard cover only**, the same value is applied as a **bonus to saving throws** against spells that cause physical damage. In addition, a character who is at least **90% behind cover** suffers **half damage on a failed saving throw** and **no damage on a successful saving throw** against such effects.

| Target is... | Cover | Concealment |
| ------------ | ----- | ----------- |
| >25% hidden  | -2    | -1          |
| >50% hidden  | -4    | -2          |
| >75% hidden  | -7    | -3          |
| >90% hidden  | -10   | -4          |

A character who is completely (100%) behind cover cannot be struck by missile attacks unless the attack is capable of destroying or bypassing the cover. For example, siege weapons may be able to smash through some obstacles and strike creatures sheltering behind them.

\* **Intervening creatures typically provide concealment rather than hard cover**, unless they are significantly larger than the target or are deliberately trying to create cover for those behind them (for example forming a shield wall).

## Opportunity Attacks
Some things a character does can create an opportunity for an opponent to immediately attack them. These attacks of opportunity are mentioned here as they are frequently triggered by movement and/or positioning, and thus important in deciding what movements a character will make.

An opportunity attack is a single free melee *strike* against a threatened creature - if a creature normally makes multiple strikes in a single attack (such as character wielding two weapons, or monsters who have a claw/claw/bite attack routine), they must choose which is being used before making an attack roll. It is 'free' because it is made *in addition to* any actions the threatening character has declared for the current round - it does not replace those actions.

There is no specific limit to the number of opportunity attacks a character may suffer in a turn - but a creature cannot make more than one attack of opportunity against the same target in the same round. There *is* also a limit to the total number of opportunity attacks a character can make in a single round. Warriors and monsters can make 3 attacks of opportunity, while other characters can only make 1. All creatures gain 1 additional opportunity attack for every 5 levels or hit dice. (a 20th level warrior can thus make up to 7 attacks of opportunity *each round*, while one of the most formidable monsters known to exist - the Tarrasque - given sufficient targets and opportunities could make up to 17 per round).

The following actions by a threatened creature create an opportunity to attack:
- Moving away from the threatening creature, unless the action declared was a 'withdrawal'
- A change in facing that results in the threatening creature now being to the rear
- Attempting to fire a missile weapon at a target other than the threatening creature.
- Attempting an unarmed attack against any foe that is not another unarmed humanoid.

Some actions that fall into these categories may not be obvious (for example mounted characters attempting to trample enemies is considered a form of overbearing which is considered an unarmed attack) - read the description of an action to determine if and under what circumstances it triggers an opportunity attack. 

In addition to the effects described above, a character who is attempting to bypass an enemy and incurs an attack of opportunity as they move away has their movement stopped **if** the result of the opportunity attack is a successful critical hit or a knockdown, otherwise the character may complete their movement.    

## Actions

### Attack
Attacking is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the most common action of combatants. When you declare an attack you must indicate **which weapon** will be used because the individual weapon's speed is a modifier to initiative. Each type of attack (Melee, Missile-like, Non-Lethal, etc) has its own rules, but all resolve with the same mechanic: the attack roll.

#### The Attack Roll
The basic mechanic of the attack roll is that each character has an effective THAC0, the number they must roll on 1d20 in order **To Hit Armor Class 0**. To determine the number needed to hit any other armor class you simply subtract target's AC from the attacker' effective THAC0. 

A character's effective THAC0 begins with their base THAC0 (determined by class and level) you then ***subtract*** all applicable modifiers. Since subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding, penalties (negative modifiers) are *added*, while bonuses (positive modifiers) are *subtracted*. 
For example, a level 7 Fighter has a base THAC0 of 14. His strength of 18 gives a +1 bonus to hit, the magical +2 sword he is using gives another bonus to hit, and before battle the cleric cast bless on the party granting an additional +1 bonus to attack rolls, for a total modifier of +4. His effective THAC0 for the attack is thus 10 (e.g. 14 base minus +4 modifier)

When the player is asked to make an attack roll, they roll 1d20, and subtract the result from their effective THAC0. This gives the lowest (best) armor class that is hit with that roll. 
For example, our fighter above rolls the d20 and the result is 7. With his effective THAC0 of 10 this roll will hit any target with an armor class of 3 (e.g. 10-7) or worse (i.e. higher than 3)

If there are modifiers the player is unaware of - for example they are unknowingly wielding a cursed weapon or affected by a spell - the DM applies these secretly.  The Armor Class the player announced is what they *believe* they hit and the DM compares this against the target's *effective* AC after adjusting for any unknown modifiers.

For example, our fighter's player announces that he hits armor class 3. The target is wearing Elven Chain Mail, +1 (AC 4), and they have a dexterity adjustment of -1 giving an actual AC of 3. The target has however also cast *displace self* which imposes a -2 penalty on the attacker (after the first attack which automatically missed). The DM applies that penalty by improving the target's AC to an effective AC of 1. The DM announces that the attack misses. 

#### Impossible To-Hit Numbers
Sometimes the attacker’s to-hit number seems impossible to roll, or conversely impossible to _not_ roll. In either case, a roll is still required. This is because modifiers—especially those known only to the DM—may change the outcome in ways the attacker cannot perceive.

Further, unless the DM rules otherwise, a natural roll of 20 is _always_ a hit, and a natural roll of 1 is _always_ a miss. The most unskilled combatant can get lucky, but even a natural 20 cannot make a mundane weapon strike a creature that is inherently immune to it, such as an ethereal or incorporeal being.

#### Critical Hits
Fantasy literature and film is full of decisive battles where a single brutal blow against an enemy can turn the tide - a limb severed, a skull cleaved. Critical hits fill this role in the game, not for the purpose of adding sickening violence, but by adding a small chance of specific injuries that help to make combat more than a simple question of who runs out of hit points first.  

A **critical hit** occurs on a natural roll of 18 or higher **if** the roll hits by at least 5. 

For example, the fighter discussed previously with an effective THAC0 of 10 rolls a 19, he thus hits any armor class of -9 or worse. If the target's *effective* armor class (after all modifiers) is worse than -4 he has scored a critical hit.

When a critical hit is scored *with a weapon*, the **base weapon damage is doubled**, or if the weapon is two or more sizes larger than the target, tripled. If the damage is already multiplied for another reason only the base weapon damage is doubled (in effect the multiplier is increased). Modifiers (strength, magical bonuses, etc.) are then added to the result. For example a light horse lance ordinarily does 1d6 damage, used while charging the rolled damage is doubled, if the attack roll results in a critical hit the rolled damage is now tripled, unless the target is smaller than size M (i.e. the lance at size L is then two or more sizes larger than the target) in which case the rolled damage is quadrupled.
If the target survives this damage they must then make a **saving throw vs death**. If the target fails this save they *may* have a specific injury which further impairs them in some manner, depending on the location and severity of the strike.

The location struck is normally determined by rolling 1d10 and consulting the table below. The exceptions are a) where the attack was a called shot, in which case the location is wherever the attacker had aimed, b) if the attacker is fighting a creature 2 or more sizes larger than themselves roll 1d6 (less likely to hit head and upper torso), c) conversely if the attacker is fighting a creature 2 or more sizes smaller than themselves roll 1d6+4 (less likely to strike legs).

| 7    | Torso     | Abdomen                 |

\* for fish- and snake-like creatures (i.e. do not have legs) treat rolls of 1-5 as tail.

The damage inflicted by the attack, tempered by the resilience of the target, affect what dice are rolled to determine the specific effect. The *potential* severity is determined by dividing the total damage inflicted by the critical hit (the multiplied weapon damage plus all applicable modifiers) by 1/4 of the target's level or HD (rounded up) and consulting the following table:

| Damage / 1/4 target's HD | Potential Severity | Dice Rolled |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ----------- |
| 0-4                      | Minor              | 1d6         |
| 5-6                      | Major              | 2d4         |
| 7-8                      | Severe             | 2d6         |
| 9+                       | Mortal             | 2d8         |

High damage critical hits against weaker enemies are consequently more likely to result in mortal injuries (if the critical damage does not kill the target outright); inflicting a mortal injury on a Dragon that has survived to Great Wyrm age however is only achievable by the greatest of warriors, and even then requires a great deal of luck.

After the location and severity have been determined the DM will consult the appropriate tables for the type of damage (bludgeoning/piercing/slashing) and type of target (humanoid/animal/monster) to determine what specific injuries were inflicted (if any).

### Types of Attacks
- **Melee Attack:** an attack with a weapon (including natural weapons such as claws) at hand-to-hand range.
- **Missile-like Attack:** attacks made at distance, with direct-fire, single target missiles such as quarrels, arrows, darts, and thrown weapons
- **Grenade-Like Attack:** attacks made at distance that have an area effect, such as flasks of poison, oil, holy water, and boulders
- **Non-Lethal Attack:** Includes overbearing, punching, wrestling, martial arts, and using weapons in a non-lethal manner
- **Touch Spell Attack:** Although they are a type of attack, these are declared as 'Casting a Spell' and are covered in that section

#### Melee Attacks
Melee attacks are arguably the most basic form of attack, the attacker attempts to strike an opponent that is within the reach of the weapon(s) in their hand(s). The attacker makes an attack roll as described above and if it is successful they roll for damage, applying any relevant damage modifiers.

If the attacker has **multiple weapons**, all the attacks are resolved on their initiative - for example many beasts will make 2 claw attacks and a bite attack, and some characters will choose to wield 2 weapons. If the attacker has **multiple attacks** (i.e. with the same weapon) the first attack occurs on their initiative, and the subsequent attack(s) occur after all combatants have made their first attacks. If more than one combatant has multiple attacks they are cycled through in initiative order, one attack at a time.

#### Missile-Like Attacks
Missile combat involves everything that melee combat does, but there are a few additional rules that apply only to missile combat.

First, the **range** of the target must be determined. If the range is greater than the long range of the weapon (see master weapons list) the target cannot be hit. If the distance is between the medium and long range, the target is at **long range** and the attack suffers a **-5 penalty**. If the distance is between the short and medium range, the target is at **medium range** and the attack suffers a **-2 penalty**. Distances less than the short range of the weapon have no penalty. Some weapons have no short range and always incur penalties.

Second, missile-like weapons have a **rate of fire**. Some are quick and can be fired/thrown multiple times per round while others are slow and can only be used every other round. If the weapon can be fired multiple times in a round, it is treated the same as a melee weapon with multiple attacks, with the first attack resolved on the attacker's initiative, and subsequent attacks occur after all primary attacks have been resolved.

Third, missile-like weapons are really meant for engaging enemies *before* they reach your lines. Once steel begins meeting steel in melee there is a risk that an ally will choose an inopportune moment to dodge in the path your missile is travelling. When missile-like weapons are **fired into melee** the DM counts the number of figures in the immediate area of the target (i.e. threatened or threatening the target), counting small creatures as 1/2, medium creatures as 1, large creatures as 2, huge creatures as 4 and gargantuan creatures as 6. The ratio of a figure's size, to the total, is the chance that they will be the actual target. For example if an ally is in single combat with an enemy of the same size, there is a 50% chance of hitting your ally.

#### Grenade-like Attacks
Grenade-like attacks resemble missile-like attacks, except that the rate of fire 1/rd, the DM determines the range based on the weight of the object thrown, and the target can simply be a point on the ground. As a guideline objects less than 5 pounds can be thrown up to 30' with medium range of 20' and short range of 10'. Exceptionally heavy objects can only be thrown with a successful bend bar/lift gates (Strength) check. An object cannot be thrown if it exceeds the characters max press.

Most grenade-like attacks involve throwing a container that contains some sort of substance that actually causes the effect. In most cases a container breaks immediately when it lands, however there may be doubt about more durable containers (a leather flask or hard pottery). In such cases an item saving throw is made (DM has the relevant info on this) to see if the container shatters, rips, or otherwise spews its contents.

Grenade-like attacks that miss the intended target still function (if the container breaks), and the DM has information on resolving these situations.

##### Notes on Specific Types of Grenade-like Attacks
- **Acid** - acids are very rare, but very useful against creatures like trolls as acid damage cannot be healed by regeneration.
- **Holy Water** - affects most types of undead and creatures from the lower planes, but has no effect on creatures that have no material form or are in a gaseous form. Similar to acid, damage from holy water cannot be regenerated. Unholy water (e.g. an evil priest's holy water) operates the same except that it affects paladins, creatures from the upper planes, and some creatures whose purpose is to defend good (lammasu, shedu, etc.)
- **Oil** - Oil only causes damage when set ablaze. This normally involves a two-step process of soaking the target in oil, and then lighting it, and thus it often requires two-attack rolls. Flaming oil burns for 2 rounds, causing 2d6 damage in the first round and 1d6 damage in the second.
- **Poison** - Few poisons are capable of being used in a grenade-like attack (most need to be ingested) but some contact poisons may work. 

### Non-Lethal Attacks
Sometimes the aim of attacking is to subdue an opponent without killing. Corpses are difficult to interrogate, civil society frowns on killing an accused before trial, and many find it distasteful to kill a comrade who is compelled by magic to attack them. There are a variety of non-lethal options that may be available to characters including pummeling, wrestling, and martial arts. Characters may also attempt to use certain weapon in a non-lethal manner (for example striking with the flat of a sword) or simply overbear their enemy. Non-Lethal Attacks are also a fall-back for characters who might find themselves caught unarmed or who are disarmed during a fight.

#### Pummelling
Pummelling includes most attacks made with hands, fists, elbows, and the like. Any creature of average intelligence that possesses appropriate appendages can attempt pummelling attacks though creatures with natural weapons typically use those instead.

To make a pummelling attack requires at least one hand free, but the hand does not need to be bare nor empty - wearing a gauntlet, using the pommel of a weapon, or improvising a weapon with what is at hand (bottles, mugs, etc), are allowed while pummelling.

Pummelling can only be attempted against targets that are alive, organic, non-vegetable, and non-fluid - undead, golems, jellies are examples of creatures that cannot be pummelled. With limited exceptions, pummelling is ineffective against creatures who can only be harmed by special or magical weapons and is always ineffective against creatures immune to bludgeoning weapons. Finally, as a general rule pummelling requires the ability to strike at the target's head and torso, consequently it usually cannot be used against a creature more than one size larger than the attacker. The DM may make exceptions where the attacker has some way to reach the target's head height (flying, fighting from some sort of platform, or the target is sitting/prone).

Without specialization, most characters can make a single pummelling attack each round (if both hands are free they may make two attacks suffering the usual penalties for attacking with two weapons). The attack is resolved using a normal attack roll. On a successful hit an opposed strength check is made to determine if the defender is knocked down. The modifiers that apply to the strength check are:
- 2 points for each size category difference between the attacker and defender (bonus if the attacker is larger, penalty if smaller)
- +1 if the attack is made with a large object
- applicable bonus for specialization, mastery, or grand mastery in pummeling

The defender is knocked down if the attacker wins the opposed strength roll. To win the attacker must succeed on their strength check, and must have a higher roll if the defender also succeeds their strength check.

Damage with fists is 1d2, small hard objects (mailed fists, bottles, weapon pommels) inflict 1d3 damage, large soft objects (for example using an unconscious character as a weapon, or hitting someone with a horse saddle) inflicts 1d4 damage, while large hard objects (chairs, tables, a sack of coins) inflict 1d6 damage. The limits on what may be used as an improvised weapon are a) the object cannot be more than 1/3rd of the attackers maximum press, and b) it's greatest dimension cannot be more than half the attacker's height. Some gear, such as the cestus, are special cases that do not follow the above rules - refer to their descriptions for more details.

**Critical hits** in pummelling follow their own rules as follows: the defender must roll a save vs. death with the attacker's hit probability adjustment (from the strength table) as a bonus or penalty - if they fail they are knocked unconscious for 3d10 rounds.

## Called Shot
A called shot is an attack carefully aimed at a specific location on a target. It can be used to strike an object the target is holding (for example to destroy the potion they were about to imbibe), to aim for a more vulnerable part of the target (an unarmoured head or face), or with the intention of causing a specific effect (blinding an enemy by attacking their eye). They may also be used when firing missiles into melee to eliminate the risk of striking an ally. Some creatures, such as slimes and oozes, have no discernible vital locations to target with a called shot; Unless the DM rules otherwise, the only benefit of making one against such creatures is ensuring allies are not struck by stray missiles.
When a called shot is declared, the specific point of aim and/or intended effect must be given, and the added care taken in aiming imposes an initiative penalty of +1. If a character suffers any effect that disrupts their aim (knocked down, grappled, etc) before their initiative, the called shot reverts to a normal attack against the target (if the player is still able to take an action).

By default called shots present the attacker with a -4 penalty on the attack roll, but the DM may modify this to reflect the circumstances; if the target is surprised and the point of aim is relatively large, there might be no penalty whereas attempting to stab an enemy through the eyeslit of their great helm during melee might inflict a penalty of -8 on the attack. If using a called shot to avoid hitting allies in melee, the attack does not risk striking an unintended target, but the called shot penalty always applies and cannot be less than -4 for this purpose. This penalty is not applied to the attack if the called shot is disrupted.

As detailed in the section on critical hits, if a called shot results in a critical hit that may cause a specific injury, the location of that injury is determined by where the critical hit was aimed. See that section for full details.

## Cover
When an enemy is unable to act (for example, stunned, dazed, pinned, unconscious, or surprised) an attacker may choose to be *prepared* to immediately complete an attack in response to what the enemy does once they are again able to act. An unconscious character could wake up to find a knife pressed to their throat or an archer, bow drawn back, aiming at them and demanding their surrender. 

A target may be covered by bows and crossbows within the short range of the weapon, or by a one-handed blade from an adjacent attacker. The attacker must be proficient with the weapon used for covering the target.

When a character declares that they are covering a target, they roll initiative as normal, but may make their first attack on the initiative count of the covered target if it precedes their own initiative by 4 or less (8 or less if the attacker has weapon specialization). This attack preempts the action taken by the target (an exception to actions on same initiative count being simultaneous). If the attacker's initiative precedes the target's, they may choose to complete the attack on their initiative, hold and continue covering the target waiting to see what they will do, or shift their attack to another target in range (losing the benefits of covering.)

In addition to preempting the target, the first attack roll is made with a +2 bonus, and the critical hit range is increased by 2 (barring other effects, natural rolls of 16 or better). 

## Guard
When a combatant takes the guard action, they are prepared to immediately make a melee attack when an enemy approaches within reach or attacks them. A guarding character is considered to be *set for a charge* gaining the -2 bonus to initiative, and with specific weapons (as indicated in the notes to the master weapons list), double-damage against a charging enemy.

When a character declares the guard action they still roll initiative as normal (with the -2 bonus for being set for a charge as already stated), however regardless of initiative score they may attack on the initiative count of a character that attacks them. If the attacker has *longer reach* than the guarding character, the two attacks occur simultaneously, otherwise the guard's attack preempts the attacker's. The exception to this is a charging attacker; In this case the character with the longer reach weapon preempts their opponent, if the reach is equal the character with weapon of greater size acts first, and if both weapons are of equal size, the character with the lower initiative score acts first. 
At the end of the round, a guarding character that has not been attacked may abort the guard and use up to 1/2 their movement to make a single melee attack. If multiple characters have 'end of round' actions, they are resolved in order of initiative as normal.

## Parry
Sometimes the best option is to simply focus your effort on not getting hit and hope that by weathering the storm you will create an opening that your allies can exploit.

When a character chooses to parry they forfeit all other actions for the round, including movement and opportunity attacks, and focus solely on avoiding and deflecting melee attacks. This grants a bonus to armor class equal to one-half of their non-warrior levels (rounded up), or one-half of their warrior levels (rounded up) plus one against melee attacks. For dual- and multi-class character calculate the parry bonus for warrior and non-warrior levels separately then add them together. For example, a 5th level thief would gain a -3 bonus to armor class, a 5th level ranger would gain a -4 bonus, and a fighter 4/cleric 4 would gain a -5 bonus. If the parrying character has a shield it's normal AC bonus applies.

Parrying offers no benefit against missile attacks and only provides a benefit against spells where the caster must touch the target.

## Special Manoeuvres
Combatants do not just stand before each other trading strikes until one falls, they employ a variety of tools, tactics, and techniques to try and gain an edge over their opponent. Some of these are unique abilities of a class or kit - such as a thief's backstab - and detailed elsewhere while the list below are available to all characters who are appropriately equipped and meet any situational requirements.
- Block
- Disarm
- Grab Item
- Pull/Trip
- Sap
- Shield-Punch
- Shield-Rush
- Special Weapon Manoeuvres
- Trap (and Break)

Some special manoeuvres are allowed to be declared on a character's turn, before they make an attack roll, rather than during initiative, but the timing of the declaration may affect how the manoeuvre functions. The DM may also choose to use these rules to adjudicate some situational (non-standard) actions, for example if a character rolls a cask down the stairs at enemies, a trip attack against each person in it's path might be appropriate.

For characters with more than one attack in a round, the special manoeuvres below use a single weapon attack (incurring the normal penalties for attacking with multiple weapons, if applicable). Additional attacks may be used as normal, if circumstances allow - A character could not, for example, make an additional attack with the weapon they are using to trap an enemy's blade.

### Block
Blocking uses a single weapon attack to deflect an opponent's melee or thrown weapon strike. It can be an excellent tactic for character's with multiple attacks to use against opponents that make only one attack - they expend one attack to fend off the enemy, and attack with the remainder. Blocks can be attempted with shields and any weapon except rope-like weapons (whips, slings, etc.) however a mundane missile weapon (bow, crossbow, etc) used in this way is ruined unless the equipment's description states otherwise.

When a character attempts a block they roll a normal attack roll against AC4 and the attacking character makes a normal attack roll against the blocking character's AC. If the attacker fails the roll, the attack misses as normal, if the blocking character fails the roll and the attacker succeeds, the attack hits as normal. If both characters succeed on their rolls, the character with the *lower dice roll* succeeds.

*For example, a fighter with an effective THAC0 of 14 is fighting a giant with an effective THAC0 of 9. The fighter attempts to block the giant's next attack. The giant makes a successful attack roll of 18, easily beating the fighter's AC 1. The fighter rolls an 11, which narrowly succeeds against AC4. Because 11 is the lower dice roll, the fighter is able to block the giant's attack, and avoid what would otherwise have been a critical hit.*

A block can be declared before initiative is rolled, or on the character's turn, before they make an attack roll, but an attack can only be blocked after the block is declared (i.e. if declared on the character's turn it can only be used on attacks that occur *after* their initiative count). The player does not have to use their block against the first attack directed at them - if they anticipate being attacked multiple times in a round it is their choice which to block - but if a block is not used by the end of the round it is wasted - it cannot be changed to a different action, and cannot be applied to an attack that has already been resolved.

With most weapons blocks can only be used against attacks directed at the blocking character, however when wielding a polearm, a block may be used to deflect attacks from large-size melee weapons against someone else, as long as *either* the attacker *or* the person being attacked is within the reach of the blocking character.  

### Disarm
Disarming is an attempt to knock a weapon or object (such as a wand, potion, or rod) out of an opponent's hand, and is most effective against opponents with poor attack bonuses. Disarms can be performed offensively or defensively - both are resolved using the same mechanics; they differ in when they occur, what weapons are allowed, and how they interact with initiative. 

When a character attempts a disarm they roll a normal attack against AC 0 while the intended victim rolls against AC 4. A character using a two-handed weapon in either role gains a +4 bonus to the AC they must roll against. The disarm is successful if the character performing the disarm succeeds and their opponent fails, or - if both succeed their rolls - they have the lower dice roll. If the disarm is successful, the victim's weapon is knocked 1d10 feet away (or 1d3-1 squares if using a 5' grid) in a random direction. If the character successfully performing a disarm has attacks remaining in the round they may choose to immediately replace one with the cover action against the disarmed character. If the disarm was performed with a melee weapon, the usual requirement that covering be performed with a one-handed blade is ignored.  

**Offensive disarms** may be attempted with melee or missile weapons (including thrown weapons) within short range. They must be declared before initiative is rolled, increase initiative by +1, and are resolved on the initiative count of the character attempting the disarm. 

**Defensive disarms** may only be attempted with melee weapons but may be declared either before initiative or on the character's turn, before an attack roll. As with blocks, a defensive disarm can only be used against an attack that occurs after the disarm is declared, does not have to be used against the first attack directed at them, and are wasted if not used by the end of the round. If a defensive disarm is unsuccessful, the attack is then resolved normally.

It is impossible to disarm a weapon two sizes larger than the one used in the disarm attempt; a dagger cannot knock a staff from a wizard's hands. If a missile weapon is used in an attempt to offensively disarm, it is the size of missile itself, not the weapon that fires it, that is used in this determination. For objects without explicit size categories, the DM adjudicates using this as a guideline.

Attempting to **disarm a shield** is a special case - a successful attempt to disarm a shield does not tear it from the wielder's arm, but will knock it out of position, such that it no longer protects the wielder. For the remainder of the round the shield-wielder loses the AC bonus of the shield (including any magical bonus to AC). Any other special properties, say the shield radiates a fear effect, are not affected.

### Grab
Grabbing is an attempt to take a weapon or object from an opponent (distinct from grabbing an opponent directly which is a grapple; refer to the rules of non-lethal attacks for more detail). To perform a grab a character must have at least one hand free (two is better of course), be within arm's reach, and must declare the attempt before making an attack roll. Obviously, attempting to grab something from a character that threatens you is dangerous, and the defender may immediately make an opportunity attack.

Grabbing begins similar to disarming, with the character attempting the grab rolling a normal attack against AC 0 and the intended victim rolling against AC 4 to see if they are able to get a grasp on the object. The DM may assign penalties to the grab attempt to reflect the circumstances and difficulty, for example trying to grab a tiny ring off someone's finger might incur a -8 penalty. In the event of a tie, and at the DM's discretion, the item being grabbed may instead be dropped or broken.

If the grabbing character successfully gets a grasp an opposed strength roll is then used to determine if they can wrench the object away from their opponent and take control of it. Each character rolls a d20 and must roll their strength score or *less*. Characters with exceptional strength (i.e. 18/xx) just use 18 for this check. If both succeed the character with the higher dice roll wins. If either character only uses one hand their strength score is reduced by 3 for the purpose of this check. 

### Pull/Trip
Tripping or pulling the legs out from under an opponent can be particularly effective when the target is moving at speed and especially when the target does not see it coming - a stationary target on the other hand is very difficult to knock down. A pull or trip can also be very effective against mounted enemies, either tripping the mount or pulling the rider off. This manoeuvre can be attempted with any long staff-like weapon - polearms, spears and harpoons,  the footman's flail, mace or pick, bills and scythes, etc.... even bows and crossbows (except the hand variety) may be used. Chain and rope-like weapons including slings and bolas are also excellent options.

To pull or trip an enemy, the intention must be declared before an attack roll is made. The character then makes a normal attack roll. If successful an opposed ability roll is made pitting the attacker's strength against the defender's dexterity. For the purpose of this check the normal movement rate of a creature is considered it's dexterity if it does not have a dexterity score.

The attacker's strength is modified for the check as follows:
- -6 if the target is stationary
- -2 if target has 4 or more legs
- +3 if the target is unaware of the attack
- +6 if the target is moving faster than it's normal movement speed

Small creatures seem to have superior tripping technique - perhaps due to their lower centre of gravity - though the sheer mass of the most enormous creatures is more than enough to overcome their advantage.  These factors affect the defender's dexterity check as follows:
- -2 if the attacker is small size or smaller 
- +4 if the defender is huge size
- +6 if the defender is gargantuan size

If the attacker wins the opposed roll (being the only one to succeed, or succeeding with the higher dice roll), the target is knocked down. If the target was mounted, they additionally suffer 1d3 damage, and if the target was a mount the rider must succeed on a riding proficiency check to land on their feet or suffer this damage). If the attack was made with a rope-like weapon such as a lasso or lariat, the target was moving faster than it's normal speed, and the attacker loses the opposed roll the attacker must choose whether they release the weapon and are disarmed or maintain their grip and are knocked down and dragged.

### Sap
Sapping is hitting an opponent's head with the aim of knocking them unconscious rather than killing. While a sap, or blackjack, is a made-for-purpose tool for doing this manoeuvre, it may be attempted with any melee weapon, striking with the flat of a blade, the haft of an axe, the pommel of a weapon, etc. Only medium-size creatures or smaller may be sapped - the mass (and also often thicker skulls) of larger enemies prevents the localised concussive trauma necessary to knock these creatures out.

A sapping attempt must be declared before initiative is rolled and increases initiative by 1. The sap is resolved with an attack roll against the target's unarmored armor class (i.e. only natural armor, dexterity and magical bonuses apply) with either a -4 penalty, or a -8 penalty if the target is wearing any kind of helmet. If the attack is successful damage is rolled as normal for the weapon, *except that* a weapon's magical bonuses to attack and damage do not apply unless the weapon is specifically intended for this use (such as a blackjack/sap) and the damage type is bludgeoning. Only 1/4 of the damage is 'real', the remainder is temporary. Ordinarily, for each point of total damage (real or temporary) inflicted there is a 5% chance (maximum 40%) that the target is knocked out. If however the victim is surprised, sleeping, restrained, or magically held, the chance of a knockout is instead 10% per point of damage (max 80%).

A sapped character remains unconscious for 2d8 full rounds.

**Mugging** is a special variant of sapping available only to thieves. Where a normal sap attempt uses brute force, mugging is a precision attack against a vulnerable point; consequently it can be used against creatures of up to large-size as long as the thief is able to reach the target's head. When making a mugging attack the thief may elect to have the attack do no damage at all (i.e. no chance of accidentally killing a target that was intended to be subdued) or to inflict entirely 'real' damage; mugging never inflicts temporary damage, and does not use the knockout percentage rules of sapping.  In order to perform a mugging attempt the thief must meet the same conditions as performing a backstab attack (e.g. must be to the enemy's rear and the enemy must not be aware of the thief). The mugging attempt incurs a -4 penalty to the attack roll if the target is wearing a helmet that *fully encloses* their head such as a great helm, but no penalty otherwise.  If the attack is successful the target must make a saving throw versus petrification, modified by half the difference in level or hit dice between the mugger and the victim (rounded down; maximum +/- 6) . On a failure the creature is knocked out for 3d10 rounds. If the victim becomes aware of the thief before the mugging attack is resolved, the attempt automatically becomes a normal sapping attack instead, subject to all the usual rules and restrictions for sapping.

Creatures that do not have a discernible head-like anatomy or who are immune to bludgeoning damage cannot be sapped nor mugged.

### Shield-Punch
Any character with a shield equipped may sacrifice it's protection (losing it's AC bonus for the round) and instead use it to strike an opponent. The character may choose either to substitute the shield punch for their normal attack, or to use it as a secondary weapon following the usual rules for fighting with multiple weapons (ordinarily -2 to attack with the primary weapon, and -4 with the secondary, slower weapon's speed is used for initiative). The intent to shield punch must be declared before initiative is rolled.

Shield punches can be useful if a character finds themselves disarmed, of if they wish to exploit an opportunity to make some extra attacks against an enemy while remaining ready to switch back to a more defensive posture. The alternative - dropping or stowing the shield, drawing a new weapon to fight with, then retrieving or re-equipping the the shield afterwards - consumes much more effort.

***editorial note***: Damage for each shield needs to be added here, or elsewise a reference to the relevant section/table (perhaps consolidate in the weapons chapter in case it is referenced elsewhere (such as special ability of a character kit) )

### Shield-Rush
A shield-rush is an attempt to knock someone down by ramming into them shield-first. It is a risky manoeuvre as the attacker can easily end up knocked down themselves whether or not they bring down the enemy. 

In order to perform a shield rush a character must have a minimum of 2 unoccupied squares (10') between themselves and the intended target. The manoeuvre replaces one attack, and is declared on the character's turn, before making an attack roll. While it is not a proper charge (i.e. does not gain the benefits of a charge), it is still treated as one in respect of the damage dealt by defenders who are set to receive a charge. In addition the attacker loses the defensive benefits of the shield for the rest of the round. 

The shield-rush is resolved with a normal attack roll, if it hits, an opposed strength roll is made - if both characters fail they both fall down, otherwise only the loser of the opposed roll is knocked down.

The attacker's strength is modified as follows:
- 4 point bonus or penalty for each size category of difference between the attacker and defender.
- +3 if the defender was not aware of the shield-rush
- -2 if the defender has 4 legs or more.

### Special Weapon Manoeuvres
Some weapon descriptions describe special manoeuvres that can be performed with a specific weapon (and in some cases the special weapon manoeuvre is the *only* way to use the weapon). These weapons include bolas, chain, harpoon, lasso, mancatcher, and net. Using these special features is treated similar to a called shot, incurring a +1 penalty to initiative, and a -4 to attack. Unlike a called shot that requires precise aim, using these attacks requires precise technique, consequently they are not disrupted in the same manner as called shots.

### Trap/Pin
Traps and Pins are defensive manoeuvres that deny an opponent the use of their weapon ; the difference between the two is mostly semantic - a trap catches an attacker's weapon and prevents the wielder from pulling it back towards themselves, while a pin holds a weapon in place - often pushed back against the wielder or a nearby surface. It can be a very effective tactic for a dual wielder to use against a single-weapon enemy, or for allies to use in concert - one character pinning an enemy's weapon while another makes attacks from a flank or rear. The person performing a pin or trap also loses use of the weapon (or shield) being used while the hold continues.

Traps are resolved when a character is attacked, and before the attack is resolved; the defender attempting the trap makes a normal attack against AC 0 while the attacker whose weapon they are attempting to trap rolls against AC 4. If the defender wins the opposed roll the weapon is trapped or pinned - otherwise the attacker may continue to make their attack roll against the defender as normal.

If the attacker's weapon is successfully trapped or pinned they lose any additional strikes *with that weapon* in the current round. They may still however - if they have additional strikes in the current round - attack with a secondary weapon (suffering the normal penalties of dual wielding) or abandon the weapon and execute attacks with another equipped weapon without the penalties of dual wielding. If the character chooses to keep hold of their weapon they may make an opposed strength roll at the end of the round to try and free their weapon.

The initiative roll determines *when* characters act within a given combat round. Initiative is not a fixed order and changes from round to round - combat is chaotic and uncertain. A character never knows for certain if he will act before or after another nor what the exact state of the battlefield will be when he acts.

There are 3 methods of determining initiative order: 
1. **Simple Group Initiative**  
  A single initiative roll for an entire side or group, with optional group-wide modifiers.
2. **Modified Group Initiative**  
  As above, but individuals apply modifiers based on their weapons, spells, or circumstances.
3. **Individual Initiative**  
  Each creature rolls separately, applying all relevant modifiers.

The DM may choose which of these three methods to use in any given round, but outside of mass combat, where simple group initiative is most appropriate, will generally have PCs roll individual initiative, and will use either individual or modified group initiative for DM controlled characters, depending on their number and similarity. Note that simple group initiative cannot be used in combination with the other methods.

The dice used for rolling initiative is 1d10 and the *lowest* modified initiative acts first. Characters with the same initiative count are acting **simultaneously** and the results of their actions are applied *afterwards*. i.e. The wizard's fireball may kill the archers at that same moment he falls to their arrows. 
### Modifiers to Initiative
When using simple group initiative only the following modifiers are used, and only *if* they apply to everyone in a group:

| Specific Situation                 | Modifier |
| ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| Hasted                             | -2       |
| Slowed                             | +2       |
| On higher ground                   | -1       |
| Set to receive a charge            | -2       |
| Wading or slippery footing         | +2       |

* This applies to situations in which the party is in a completely different environment (swimming underwater without the aid of a ring of free action, for example).

For modified group and individual initiative, the following modifiers that are dependent on the action that was declared:

\* The bonus of magical weapons improves (reduces) their speed factor

\** This applies only to creatures fighting with natural weapons--claws, bites, etc. Creatures using weaponry use the speed factor of the weapon, regardless of the creature's size.

\*** Use the initiative modifier listed unless the item description says otherwise.
 
### Multiple Attacks and Initiative
There are two distinct cases of multiple attacks:
1. Multiple Weapons (including natural weapons)
    These attacks are resolved on the same initiative count
2. Multiple attacks with same weapon
    The first attack occurs on the initiative count.
    Additional attacks occur after all combatants have made their primary attacks (i.e cycle through initiative order multiple times as needed) 

### Spellcasting and initiative
Casting times of spells may be listed with or without units of time given (e.g. rounds, hours, etc). If there is no unit of time given, the number given is the modifier to the initiative roll. If there *is* a unit of time specified, no initiative roll is made - the spell instead takes effect at the end of the last round of it's casting time (so with a casting time of 1 rd. the *infravision* spell would take effect at the end of the round during which it was cast)

## Special Combat Situations

### Mounted Combat
Combat on horseback - or any other mount - is not just normal fighting with greater height and speed, it is a trade off of precision and flexibility for speed and shock. The mass and momentum of the mount and the need to guide and control a living creature through the chaos of battle change the very nature of the fight. What follows are some additional rules specific to using mounts in battle and how the combat options presented earlier in the chapter are altered when the thunder of hooves pounding earth echoes across the battlefield.

#### Mounts - Untrained vs Trained
Mounts not specifically trained for combat are easily spooked by the noise and confusion of battle. All attacks made by the rider while mounted on such a beast incur a -2 penalty. Further if an untrained animal takes damage or is startled by a surprising event (a fireball exploding nearby, etc.) the rider must make a riding proficiency check to keep control of their mount and individuals that lack that proficiency automatically fail. On a failed check, the animal panics and bolts in a somewhat random direction (more often in the direction it is already facing but it will not run directly at something it recognises as a danger) at 1.5 times its movement rate for 1d4 rounds. If there is no direction for it to flee the animal rears and bucks uncontrollably until there is a path for it to flee or until it is brought under control by the rider. A character proficient in riding or animal handling may attempt a check to regain control of the animal at the end of each round. Lastly, untrained mounts cannot move perpendicular to their facing - a move to the left or right requires the animal to turn their facing ten move increasing the risk that an opportunity attack will be triggered.

Mounts that are trained for combat, such as warhorses, do not have any of the limitations or penalties described above.

#### Fighting from the Saddle
The following changes to the normal rules of combat apply when mounted:
- While mounted a rider and their mount are considered to have the same facing and act on the same initiative count. 
- Where a movement rate or size category are referenced in a rule, those of the mount are used except when determining a rider's reach. 
- The rider's stance (mounted) is treated as equivalent to standing except that they cannot change to a different stance while they remain mounted.
- Running/Sprinting uses the (inferred) ability scores of the mount for checks, not the riders, but the rider is still restricted from taking any other actions (except a flying tackle) during the round as normal, as they are busy controlling the mount.
- A mounted combatant can execute a withdrawal by 'reining back' their mount, but can only do so at 1/4 of their movement rate.
- At the DM's discretion a rider's reach may be *decreased* due to size of the mount and/or the riders position on it - For example, a rider perched in a howdah strapped to the back of a fully-grown elephant is unlikely to be able to strike a dismounted medium-sized target with their short sword.
- A rider threatens squares within reach to their flank in addition to those to their front, and their mount separately threatens squares as normal (note that a creature that can kick back like a horse also threatens to their rear when controlled by a rider)
- Due to the higher vantage afforded by being mounted the rider gains +1 to bonus to attack rolls against creatures of smaller-size (than the mount) and opponents on foot suffer a -1 penalty to attack the rider (but not the mount) with melee weapons.
- The following actions cannot be performed while mounted: pummeling, wrestling, martial arts, overbearing, shield rush, trap (and break) and charging (instead use mounted charges, detailed later in this section).
- The following actions cannot be performed while a mount is in motion: casting a spell, called shots, covering,

#### Archery from Horseback
Combining the extra mobility offered by a mount with the superior range of bows and crossbows, mounted archers can be truly devastating particularly when directed at dismounted enemies that lack the means to attack at range - the archers gallop in, fire, then retreat back out of reach.

While mounted archers may not use long bows or heavy crossbows, and composite long bows must be custom made (at twice the cost) for the purpose, all other known bows are viable options.

The movement of a mount, and the need to keep control of the creature, does however affect the archer's ability to aim and reload:  A character may choose to take no penalty to attacks, at the cost of all voluntary movement for the round. If the character accepts a -2 penalty on attacks in the round, they may move up to half the mount's normal movement rate. If the character accepts a -4 penalty on attacks in the round they may move their full movement, however their rate of fire also decreases by 1. As usual when a mount is moving at a full run or sprint, the rider is not able to make attacks.

#### Jousting
While historically jousting was almost entirely an entertainment performed at tournaments to win favour or fortune, or more rarely, to settle disputes, it is a useful short-hand for any situation where mounted opponents equipped with *piecing weapons of equivalent reach*, such as lances, attack each other.

When a joust occurs the attacks are considered simultaneous regardless of initiative rolls and occur on the earliest initiative count of the two characters. A character with multiple attacks per round may only strike with their (primary) weapon once in a jousting round, though they may in the turn the joust attacks are resolved declare they are using an additional attack to perform a block or a shield-punch. As an exception to the normal rules that blocks only apply to attacks *after* their initiative, a block declared in these circumstances applies to the simultaneous attack. While jousting a successful block performed with a shield also has a chance of breaking the opponent's weapon - the blocking character rolls 1d6 and if the result is 1 or 2 they have managed to break the enemy's weapon, the remnants of which may only be used as a club.

While lances may be used in many ways, their design was optimized specifically for jousting, not only for inflicting damage but also for unhorsing opponents. See the *Being Unhorsed* section below for details.  

#### Being Unhorsed
A major hazard of mounted combat is the risk of suddenly and unexpectedly becoming dismounted. This can happen if the mount is killed, the rider is pulled from the saddle, or even when simply struck by a very solid blow.

In many cases a proficient rider has a chance to either resist being unhorsed or to at least land on their feet and avoid taking damage by succeeding on a riding proficiency check; a non-proficient character automatically fails. A failed check results in the target being knocked prone, suffering 1d3 points of damage (DM may adjust damage based on terrain, the specific mount, and the manner of unhorsing), and being unable to take any other actions in the round. This applies when:
- The mount is killed from under the rider
- A successful pull or trip attack is made against the mount or rider
- A natural 20 is rolled resulting in a successful attack against the rider by any character wielding a large melee weapon, or by a mounted opponent with a medium melee weapon
- A lance strike does 8 points of damage (after doubling) or more while jousting.

In cases where a rider is unable to move freely, such as when tackled by another rider, overborne by dismounted opponents, ensnared or entangled by nets, lassos, etc. they are unable to resist being unmounted, cannot control their fall, and follow the rules that describe those attacks. 

#### Specific Mounted Actions

##### Flying Tackle
A mounted character may attempt to tackle a mounted opponent to try and unhorse them. This action may be declared on a character's turn either when their action for the round was running/sprinting, or when they have declared an attack, before the attack roll is made, in which case it replaces the attack action.

The flying tackle is an unarmed attack and may trigger opportunity attacks as normal. The attempt begins with a normal attack roll. If this misses the attacker falls to the ground, prone and suffering damage. If the attack is successful, an opposed dexterity roll is then made. If the attacker wins the opposed roll, they have taken control of the mount and the target has been unhorsed, falling prone, and suffering damage. If the target wins the opposed roll, they maintain control of the mount, but the attacker has managed to find a handhold and is hanging on, feet dangling just above the ground, and on a subsequent round may either make one-handed attacks with a small weapon, or unarmed attacks against mount or rider. If both characters fail the opposed roll, both attacker and target fall prone and suffer damage.

The damage for a character that falls to the ground as a result is 1d3 multiplied by the speed multiplier of the attacker's mount. 

##### Mounted Charges
Whereas a dismounted charge is an attempt to smash *into* an enemy with greater force, a mounted charge is an attempt to smash *through* the enemy, breaking up formations and scattering individuals. Resolving a mounted charge is more complex then other actions as the order in which the attacker and defenders act is determined by position and reach, and it is necessary to work though each step of the mounted charge's movement until either the defenders break the charge, the attacker breaks through (e.g. has no more enemies along their straight line path), or the mount's movement is expended.

As with a dismounted charge this manoeuvre begins with movement; this must be a straight line and a minimum of half the mount's movement rate must be expended before an enemy is reached or the attempt reverts to a normal mounted attack. The maximum movement during the charge is **one and one-half times** the mount's movement rate. The momentum of a mounted charge grants a **+2 bonus** to attack rolls made during the charge, and as noted in the Master Weapons Table, some weapons inflict double damage when used while charging. Unlike a dismounted charge however, it does not incur penalties to initiative nor to AC, though a defender set for a charge still inflicts double damage when they make a successful attack. Only melee weapons may be used by the attacker performing a mounted charge.

A mount that is charging may not use any of it's attacks, however while the charge continues and there is an enemy threatened by the rider, the rider may continue making one melee strike against a creature they threaten at each step (5' of movement), up to their total number of attacks plus half the number of attacks their mount would normally make (rounded up). As an exception to the normal rules for multiple attacks with the same weapon, all these attacks are resolved within a single initiative count (i.e. during the charge). Any attacks that are not completed before the charge ends are lost.

When a step of movement results in the charging mount entering a square occupied by a dismounted enemy of lesser size, that defender must save vs. paralyzation with a -4 penalty added for each difference in size category beyond the first. On a fail the creature is knocked prone and suffers 1d4 bludgeoning damage from being trampled by the mount. On a successful save the character keeps their feet but is forced into an adjacent square of their choice. If the mount attempts to enter a square occupied by a dismounted enemy of equal size, an opposed strength check is made. If the mount wins the defender is forced into an adjacent square of the defender's choosing while if the defender wins the mount is unable to enter the square and the charge is broken with the mount remaining in the square they were attempting to leave. The mount cannot attempt to enter a square occupied by an enemy of larger size.

Riding through a thicket of enemy is clearly not without risk: Subject to all the normal rules for opportunity attacks (maximum number per round, no more than one against the same target in a round, etc.) defenders gain an opportunity attack against *either* the mount or the rider (defender's choice), immediately upon the charging mount *entering* their threatened area. As given in the opportunity attack rules, an attack that results in a knock down or that is a successful critical hit automatically stops the charging character's movement, breaking the charge. In addition if a mount takes damage from an attack, the rider must make a riding proficiency check, or if not proficient a saving throw vs. paralyzation to keep control of the animal. A failure also results in the charge being broken.

In subsequent rounds, if the trapped/pinned weapon has not been abandoned, the trapping/pinning character may declare at initiative that they are maintaining the hold. Opposed strength checks are made on the earlier inititative count of the two characters, and again at the end of each round, until the weapon is either freed or abandoned. While a character continues to keep hold of a trapped/pinned weapon they may not make opportunity attacks.
